bio: Broadly, I combine neuroimaging (primarily fMRI), behavioral experimentation, mathematical modeling, and modern “machine-learning” approaches to investigate biological mechanisms underlying our ability to draw meaningful information from the world around us. My work is closely related to the fields of categorization and decision-making.
