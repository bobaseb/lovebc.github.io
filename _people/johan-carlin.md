bio: I am interested in the cortical representation of high-level visual percepts, and in how attention, learning and memory modulate perceptual representations to support flexible behaviour. To this end, I use multivariate representational similarity approaches to compare the predictions of computational models to data from functional MRI, eye-tracking and psychophysics experiments.
