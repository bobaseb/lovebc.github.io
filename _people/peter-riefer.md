bio: In my projects, I’m trying to understand human decision-making, particularly in economic contexts. On the one hand, I’m working on a project about choice exploration and exploitation. The focus here is on how people sample available options in non-stationary environments. On the other hand, I concern myself with cooperation and coordination of people in large groups.
