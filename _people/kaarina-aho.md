bio: As a student of the Ecological Brain DTP, I am interested in how humans acquire concepts in a largely unsupervised manner amidst the noise and complexity of the real world. Specifically, my research explores integration across conceptual spaces as a model for human concept formation. Using machine learning methods applied to multimodal naturalistic data, I aim to investigate how humans learn about the world outside of the lab.
