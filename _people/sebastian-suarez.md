bio: My work focuses on the cognitive mechanisms that are necessary for the implementation of “fast and frugal” decision making heuristics. I am specifically interested in the role of attentional control when applying two popular heuristics known as Tallying and Take-the-Best. The end goal is to use neuroscientific techniques to characterize these mechanisms and explain them in terms of a computational model.
