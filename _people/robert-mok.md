bio: I am interested in how the brain constructs our perception of the world and how we can flexibly adapt to perform our goals. My current research focusses on category learning in the brain using fMRI (including multivariate pattern analysis) and behavioural methods. Recently, I have been thinking about these questions in terms of concepts and abstract thought - how does the brain organise abstract information during learning? I am intrigued by recent work that suggests the brain might construct a 'cognitive map' for coding different types of task-relevant information, including regions in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex.
