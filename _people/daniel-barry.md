bio: My research interests encompass the neural bases of human memory and imagination. To gain a better understanding of these processes, I combine functional MRI and MEG methods, with real-world behaviours. I am currently incorporating neuroscientific findings into the design of artificial neural networks, with a view to enhancing their performance and making them more human-like in their operation.
