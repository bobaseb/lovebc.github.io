bio: My research focuses on human learning, decision making and the ways it can be improved. For example – in one of my projects – I am trying to understand how consumers develop preferences and forage for information in complex environments. A key aim of this research is to inform the design of systems that aid decision making, such as recommender systems. Across all of my work, I’m keen to be data-driven, using cognitive models and machine learning wherever possible.
