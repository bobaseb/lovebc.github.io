bio: I am a current PhD student in the lab. My general academic interests span many areas in cognitive science and more specifically decision making. I study decision making in various contexts. An example may be a psychiatrist predicting whether their patient will become violent. I take a data-driven approach, in which I look at models of memory and retrieval, thus linking previous training and experience to different decisions. I analyse models of human category learning and optimise the training given to humans to achieve the best possible outcome (whether highest accuracy, or easiest training). I am currently researching human limitations in memory, through building exemplar-based models of category learning. I’ve graduated from Cognitive Science at Edinburgh University, where I studied a model of how infants segment fluent speech into discrete words. In the past I’ve also worked in data analytics using large-scale text analysis.
