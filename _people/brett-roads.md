bio: The goal of my research is to boost human learning and decision making using formal models of cognition. I use formal models
ranging from highly constrained psychological models to relatively unconstrained artificial neural networks. My current research 
focuses on developing psychological stimulus representations and category learning models in order to make more accurate 
predictions of learning outcomes.
