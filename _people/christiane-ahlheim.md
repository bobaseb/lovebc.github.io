bio: I aim to understand how we flexibly combine information to organise our experiences and which brain areas are involved in this process. To this end, I use behavioural as well as functional neuroimaging data and combine multivariate with explorative data analysis techniques to derive an estimate of the dimensionality of the neural code.
