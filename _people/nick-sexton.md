bio: I'm interested in neural network models and human high-level cognition, and making links between the two. Currently I'm exploring an embedding spaces perspective on mental representations. Specifically, linking human brain data and neural network models by comparing their representations in embedding space. Mostly, my methods involve deep neural network models trained end-to-end on naturalistic datasets (e.g., categorisation of real-world images). My PhD was on modelling backward inhibition within human task switching (the n-2 repetition cost), and I remain interested in mechanistic accounts of human cognitive control processes.
