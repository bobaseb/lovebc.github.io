bio: My PhD is about the relationship between simple decision making heuristics (e.g., fast and frugal heuristics) and rational models of cognition, i.e., Bayesian inference models. I am interested in showing that these two opposing approaches to cognition are in fact compatible and can be integrated in one overarching approach. I make use of several common machine learning techniques like ridge regression to characterize the formal mathematical relationship between simple heuristics and more traditional regression approaches. This research is applied to medical decision making: we are working with psychiatrists on designing a new test instrument that better predicts whether a patient is likely to commit violence in the future again. These test outcomes are of great importance as they often influence the court's decision about whether a patient is sentenced or released.
