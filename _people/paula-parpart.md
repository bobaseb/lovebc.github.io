bio: My PhD is about the relationship between simple decision making heuristics (e.g., fast and frugal heuristics) and rational models of cognition, i.e., Bayesian inference models. I am interested in showing that these two opposing approaches to cognition are in fact compatible and can be integrated in one overarching approach. I make use of several common machine learning techniques like ridge regression to characterize the formal mathematical relationship between simple heuristics and more traditional regression approaches.
