bio: My PhD is about the relationship between simple decision making heuristics (e.g., fast and frugal heuristics) and rational models of cognition, i.e., Bayesian inference models. I am interested in showing that these two opposing approaches to cognition are in fact compatible and can be integrated in one overarching approach. I make use of several common machine learning techniques like ridge regression to characterize the formal mathematical relationship between simple heuristics and more traditional regression approaches. This research is applied to medical decision making: we are working with psychiatrists on designing a new test instrument that better predicts whether a patient is likely to commit violence in the future again. These test outcomes are of great importance as they often influence the courtâ€™s decision about whether a patient is sentenced or released. This PhD is funded by the Centre for Doctoral Training in Financial Computing & Analytics UK. Before coming to London, I worked as a research assistant at the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (abc) at the Max-Planck Institute of Human Development, Berlin, where I did research on the dynamics of simple heuristics, cognitive control and the role of individual differences.
