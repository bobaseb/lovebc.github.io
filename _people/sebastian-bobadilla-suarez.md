bio: During my PhD, I worked on various different topics such as heuristics and biases in decision-making as well as on models of similarity for neuroimaging data. Currently, I am working on attention and similarity models for electro-physiological data. Other efforts include linking decision heuristics to principled statistical models and analysis of fMRI data related to subjective value and confidence.
