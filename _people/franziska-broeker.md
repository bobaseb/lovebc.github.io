bio: My research focuses on semi-supervised learning, incorporating behavioural and computational approaches. In my current project I aim to better understand the role of feedback in category learning and how this is tied to mental representations. More generally, I am interested in building models that can capture learning in naturalistic setups in order to predict optimal learning conditions. I am a PhD student with the Gatsby Unit at UCL, but can currently be found at the MPI for Biological Cybernetics where I am supervised by Peter Dayan.
