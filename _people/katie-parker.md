bio: My work is focused on understanding the cognitive biases and limitations involved in human probabilistic judgment and choice. I am interested in the effects of different informational frames and formats on decision making where numerical and statistical data is involved. Applications of my work include systems and interface recommendations to support professional forecasting and monitoring judgments, and consumer decision making in health, well being and financial contexts.
