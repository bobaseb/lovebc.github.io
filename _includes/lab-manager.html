<p>My research interests focus on face perception, visual attention and decision making.
More specifically, I am interested in how humans form first impressions, visual attentional patterns and rank-based
decision making with an emphasis on brain imaging analysis techniques. My most recent project studied the effects of
choice judgments on the brain, using multivariate representational similarity models to see patterns of face-selection when
forming first impressions. In the past, I have also worked on drug testing and how different hormones affect the brain.
My interests in cognitive neuroscience expand over fMRI, MEG and eye-tracking experiments.</p>
