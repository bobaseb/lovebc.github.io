             Welcome. I am Professor of Cognitive and Decision Sciences in Experimental Psychology at UCL and a fellow at the Alan Turing Institute for data science. My lab's research centers around human learning and decision making, integrating behavioural, computational, and neuroscience perspectives. The lab consists of a lab manager, four postdocs, five PhD students, and a number MSc and BS students. My apologies for the perestroika kitsch.
            
            Availability: Meeting Times: T-Th 12-8 PM, when available. I've already hit my PhD viva quota for 2015-2016 academic year. Feel free to try me for ad hoc reviews, but two editing jobs lead to a low accept rate, sorry.
