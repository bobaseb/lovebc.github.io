                  <p>My research interests focus on face perception, visual attention and decision making. More specifically, I am interested in how humans form first impressions, visual attentional patterns and rank-based decision making with an emphasis on brain imaging analysis techniques. My most recent project studied the effects of choice judgments on the brain, using multivariate representational similarity models to see patterns of face-selection when forming first impressions. In the past, I have also worked on drug testing and how different hormones affect the brain. My interests in cognitive neuroscience expand over fMRI, MEG and eye-tracking experiments. </p>

                  <p>My research is focused on knowledge representation and psychological processes of judgement and decision making. As a behavioural scientist by training, I take quantitative approaches to understand human behaviour.</p>

                  <p>I am interested in the cortical representation of high-level visual percepts, and in how attention, learning and memory modulate perceptual representations to support flexible behaviour. To this end, I use multivariate representational similarity approaches to compare the predictions of computational models to data from functional MRI, eye-tracking and psychophysics experiments.</p>

                  <p>I am a current PhD student in the lab. My general academic interests span many areas in cognitive science and more specifically decision making. I study decision making in various contexts. An example may be a psychiatrist predicting whether their patient will become violent. I take a data-driven approach, in which I look at models of memory and retrieval, thus linking previous training and experience to different decisions. I analyse models of human category learning and optimise the training given to humans to achieve the best possible outcome (whether highest accuracy, or easiest training). I am currently researching human limitations in memory, through building exemplar-based models of category learning.</p>
                  <p>I&#8217;ve graduated from Cognitive Science at Edinburgh University, where I studied a model of how infants segment fluent speech into discrete words. In the past I&#8217;ve also worked in data analytics using large-scale text analysis.</p>

                  <p>My PhD is about the relationship between simple decision making heuristics (e.g., <em>fast and frugal</em> heuristics) and rational models of cognition, i.e., Bayesian inference models. I am interested in showing that these two opposing approaches to cognition are in fact compatible and can be integrated in one overarching approach. I make use of several common machine learning techniques like ridge regression to characterize the formal mathematical relationship between simple heuristics and more traditional regression approaches. This research is applied to medical decision making: we are working with psychiatrists on designing a new test instrument that better predicts whether a patient is likely to commit violence in the future again. These test outcomes are of great importance as they often influence the court&#8217;s decision about whether a patient is sentenced or released.</p>
                  <p>This PhD is funded by the Centre for Doctoral Training in Financial Computing &amp; Analytics UK. Before coming to London, I worked as a research assistant at the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (abc) at the Max-Planck Institute of Human Development, Berlin, where I did research on the dynamics of simple heuristics, cognitive control and the role of individual differences.</p>

                  <p>In my projects, I&#8217;m trying to understand human decision-making, particularly in economic contexts. On the one hand, I&#8217;m working on a project about choice exploration and exploitation. The focus here is on how people sample available options in non-stationary environments. On the other hand, I concern myself with cooperation and coordination of people in large groups.

                  <p>My work focuses on the cognitive mechanisms that are necessary for the implementation of &#8220;fast and frugal&#8221; decision making heuristics. I am specifically interested in the role of attentional control when applying two popular heuristics known as Tallying and Take-the-Best. The end goal is to use neuroscientific techniques to characterize these mechanisms and explain them in terms of a computational model.</p>
                  <p>I have previously collaborated with Benedetto De Martino in studies regarding value based decision making and currently collaborate with Tali Sharot in studies about second-order decision making (i.e. letting someone choose for you).</p>
                  <p>My previous background is in social cognition and social anthropology. I realized fieldwork characterizing psychopathological classifications of the Popoluca and Mestizo populations of Soteapan, Veracruz.</p>

                  <p>My work is focused on understanding the cognitive biases and limitations involved in human probabilistic judgment and choice. I am interested in the effects of different informational frames and formats on decision making where numerical and statistical data is involved. Applications of my work include systems and interface recommendations to support professional forecasting and monitoring judgments, and consumer decision making in health, well being and financial contexts.</p>
                  <p>My previous work has focused on aspects of behavioural economics and consumer financial decision making, with a view to promoting saving and investing behaviours. I have a background in sport and exercise psychology with applications to business and organisational success, general population health, and elite sport performance. I am interested in applying behavioural data to inform systems design and enhance human judgment and experience across varied expert and consumer arenas.</p>
